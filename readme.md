## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I need to fix the lives. At this point in time you can just enter evey number in every spot to finish the board.
* [ ] I want to add a function where you can add what numbers you think it will be instead of guessing the number. Help keep track of what numbers can go where.
* [ ] I want to make the game look prettier.
